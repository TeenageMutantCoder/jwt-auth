# jwt-auth

This is a simple project I am making to learn back-end development. I thought it would be easiest to start small with a quick project that would implement the important parts of back-end development (i.e. user authentication, database interaction, etc.)

Tech stack:

- MongoDB
- Express
- Node

## How to Run

1. Open a terminal
2. Clone the github repository with `git clone https://github.com/TeenageMutantCoder/jwt-auth`
3. Change directories into the repository folder with `cd jwt-auth`
4. Install needed dependencies with `npm install` **Note: Must have Node installed before doing this**
5. Run the server with `npm start`
